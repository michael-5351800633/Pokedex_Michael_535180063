# Flutter Pokédex
## Setup your IDE
1. [Download and install the flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
2. [Setup your favorite code editor](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/editor)
3. Optional: [Make sure everything works](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/test-drive)

## Start the Pokédex
After you have cloned the repository, you will need to run `flutter pub get`.
This will install the dependencies of the project. When this completes you are ready to start the app.

In Visual Studio Code this is done by first clicking on “No Device” in the bottom right and thereafter selecting the installed emulator, you wish to use.

In Android Studio click on “AVD Manager”-icon in the upper right corner. This will give you a menu in which you can choose your favorite emulator.

When the emulator is up and running, you can start the app in debug mode by navigating to Debug -> Start Debugging in the topmenu, or you can just start the app by running `flutter run`. Debug mode is of course preferable.
